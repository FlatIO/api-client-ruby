# Flat API client for Ruby

Official client for the [Flat REST API](https://flat.io/developers/docs/api/), generated from Flat's
public OpenAPI specification and kept current automatically.

```sh
gem install flat_api
```

```ruby
require 'flat_api'

client = FlatApi::FlatClient.new(access_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN')
puts client.account.get_authenticated_user.username
```

Get a token in seconds with a [Personal Access Token](https://flat.io/developers/apps); it works
exactly like an OAuth access token for your own account.

## What this client does for you

- **Typed errors.** Branch on the error, not the status code. Flat returns HTTP 403 for both rate
  limiting and authorization failures, so status alone cannot tell them apart.
- **Automatic retries.** Rate limits and server errors are retried with backoff. Flat sends no
  `Retry-After`, so the client reads `X-RateLimit-Reset` instead.
- **Automatic pagination.** Eight collection endpoints are cursor-paginated with the cursor in a
  `Link` header. You get an iterator; you never touch a cursor.
- **OAuth2 built in.** Authorization URLs, code exchange and transparent token refresh.
- **Full type information**, so your editor and your coding assistant both know the API.

### Pagination

```ruby
client.paginate(:list_collections, parent: 'user') do |collection|
  puts collection.title
end
```

`paginate` takes any operation: positional arguments are its path parameters, keywords its query
parameters. It follows the cursor for you and stops at the last page.

### Errors

```ruby
begin
  # ...
rescue FlatApi::FlatRateLimitError => e
  puts "retry after #{e.reset}"
rescue FlatApi::FlatNotFoundError
  puts 'no such score'
end
```

### Asynchronous use

Synchronous only: async is not idiomatic in Ruby for this shape of client.

## Supported versions

Ruby 3.3 and 3.4. Versions past their upstream end of life are not supported; see
[MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md) if you are on an older runtime.

## Documentation

- [Quickstart](QUICKSTART.md), install to first call
- [Per-operation reference](docs/reference/), generated
- [API documentation](https://flat.io/developers/docs/api/)
- [Migrating from 0.3.x](MIGRATION.md)

## Verifying this gem

Published through RubyGems trusted publishing, so no long-lived API key exists that could publish
under this name. The release workflow is the only publisher, and each release is tied to the commit
and the API specification version it was generated from.

```sh
gem fetch flat_api
gem spec flat_api-*.gem
```

## How this client is maintained

Generated from the public specification published at
[FlatIO/api-reference](https://github.com/FlatIO/api-reference). A new specification release
regenerates, validates and publishes this package automatically, so it never drifts from the API.

Files under `docs/reference/` and the client sources are generated: edit the generator configuration
in `tools/`, not the output.

#Flat API

#The Flat API allows you to easily extend the abilities of the [Flat Platform](https://flat.io), with a wide range of use cases including the following:  * Creating and importing new music scores using MusicXML, MIDI, Guitar Pro (GP3, GP4, GP5, GPX, GP), PowerTab, TuxGuitar and MuseScore files * Browsing, updating, copying, exporting the user's scores (for example in MP3, WAV or MIDI) * Managing educational resources with Flat for Education: creating & updating the organization accounts, the classes, rosters and assignments.  The Flat API is built on HTTP. Our API is RESTful It has predictable resource URLs. It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. It also accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body. The [schema](/swagger.yaml) of this API follows the [OpenAPI Initiative (OAI) specification](https://www.openapis.org/), you can use and work with [compatible Swagger tools](http://swagger.io/open-source-integrations/). This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).  You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Flat's API. This specification and reference is [available on Github](https://github.com/FlatIO/api-reference).

  # unit tests for create_score
  # Create a new score
  # Use this API method to **create a new music score in the current User account**. This API endpoints provides 3 ways to create scores:  * &#x60;ScoreCreationBuilderData&#x60; : Create a blank score by providing the list of instruments to use. You can optionally customize the initial key signature, time signature, enable TABs, Chord grids, as well as the page layout. * &#x60;ScoreCreationFileImport&#x60;: Import an existing MusicXML 3 file (&#x60;vnd.recordare.musicxml&#x60; or &#x60;vnd.recordare.musicxml+xml&#x60;), a MIDI file (&#x60;audio/midi&#x60;), Guitar Pro (GP3, GP4, GP5, GPX, GP), PowerTab, TuxGuitar, or MuseScore file to create the new Flat document. * &#x60;ScoreCreationGoogleDriveImport&#x60;: Import an existing Google Drive file from the connected Google Drive account.  This API call will automatically create the first revision of the document, the score can be modified by the using our web application or by uploading a new revision of this file (&#x60;POST /v2/scores/{score}/revisions/{revision}&#x60;).  The currently authenticated user will be granted owner of the file and will be able to add other collaborators (users and groups).  If no &#x60;collection&#x60; is specified, the API will create the score in the most appropriate collection. When using an OAuth2 access token or a personal token, the score will be automatically added to your dedicated app collection in the account (&#x60;/v2/collections/app&#x60;).  If a &#x60;collection&#x60; is specified and this one has more public privacy settings than the score (e.g. &#x60;public&#x60; vs &#x60;private&#x60; for the score), the privacy settings of the created score will be adjusted to the collection ones.  You can check the adjusted privacy settings in the returned score &#x60;privacy&#x60;, and optionally adjust these settings if needed using &#x60;PUT /scores/{score}&#x60;.

When called by an owner/admin, it will schedule the deletion of the score, its revisions, and complete history. The score won&#39;t be accessible anymore after calling this method and the user&#39;s quota will directly be updated.
